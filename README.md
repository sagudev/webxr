# rust-webxr

[![Build Status](https://github.com/servo/webxr/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/servo/webxr/actions)

A safe Rust API that provides a way to interact with virtual reality and
augmented reality devices and integration with OpenXR. The API is inspired by
the WebXR Device API (https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/) but adapted to Rust design
patterns.

It's used in the WebXR implementation for the Servo browser, but can be used
outside of Servo.

Some notes on our plans for this API:
